      Space-delimited list of bridge:port mappings. Ports will be added to
      their corresponding bridge. The bridges will allow usage of flat or
      VLAN network types with Neutron and should match this defined in
      bridge-mappings.
      .
      Ports provided can be the name or MAC address of the interface to be
      added to the bridge. If MAC addresses are used, you may provide multiple
      bridge:mac for the same bridge so as to be able to configure multiple
      units. In this case the charm will run through the provided MAC addresses
      for each bridge until it finds one it can resolve to an interface name.
      Port can also be a linuxbridge bridge. In this case a veth pair will be
      created, the ovs bridge and the linuxbridge bridge will be connected. It
      can be useful to connect the ovs bridge to juju bridge.

      Enable local Neutron DHCP and Metadata Agents. This is useful for
      deployments which do not include a neutron-gateway (do not require l3,

      minimum version of Open vSwitch.
      .
      NOTE: this feature is deprecated and removed in Openstack >= Ocata. As of
      that point the only way to disable protection will be via the port

      Multiple devices can be configured by providing multi values delimited by
      spaces.
